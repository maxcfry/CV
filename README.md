As a software developer and with an academic background in philosophy and music, I am accustomed to adapting to new professions and finding unexpected connections between skillsets. I am looking for a role as a junior software developer because I am passionate about finding logical and creative solutions to complex problems.

I achieved a Masters with Distinction and a First-Class Bachelor's Degree in Philosophy from Durham University, taught myself the basics of software development, and spent four intense months learning TDD (Test-Driven-Development) and OOP (Object-Oriented-Programming) in two primary language stacks (Ruby and JavaScript) at Makers Academy, a coding boot camp. I learnt full language stacks in short timeframes, familiarised myself with foreign technologies and practiced Agile ceremonies, applying what I had learnt each week to produce 25 applications. Aside from Software Development and Philosophy, I have also previously worked as a professional Live Musician, Grade 8 Bass Guitarist and Actor. 

A career in tech excites me because it provides an opportunity to consolidate the analytical and creative skills I have acquired through philosophy and music. I look forward to building imaginative programs and refining my software development skills alongside seasoned professionals. 



**Tech Skills** : Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL

## Projects
- Designed and built 25 web applications mainly in Ruby and JavaScript, learning new language stacks in short timeframes. For a complete list, see my [GitHub](https://github.com/maxcfry?tab=repositories).
